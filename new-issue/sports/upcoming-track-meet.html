      <p>
        Roosevelt High School is hosting an open amateur track meet. <br>Anyone is welcome
        to join. <br>Participate in our joggers mile. Everyone writes down their time at
        the beginning, no one is allowed to wear a watch during the race and the person
        who finishes closest to their estimated time takes home a pie!
