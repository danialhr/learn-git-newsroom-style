Soduku craze is sweeping the nation. Sudoku, originally called Number Place, is a logic-based number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3¡Á3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", "regions", or "subsquares") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a unique solution.
