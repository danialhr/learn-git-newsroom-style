Cat Show at City center!

Calling all cat lovers.  International group of cat lovers, Feline Passion, will be organising a cat show at City Center this week.  Aptly named, “Paws at the Pumpkin Patch”, the show promises to feature all kinds and colours of cat.

If you are unable catch this show, you will not be disappointed. Feline Passion will come back next February with another show named “My Furry Valentine.”
